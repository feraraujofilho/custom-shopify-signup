# Custom Signup App for Shopify

A Shopify app that provides a customizable signup form with reseller tracking capabilities through URL parameters using [Theme Extensions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions). This app enables merchants to track customer referrals and create custom signup experiences for their stores.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This is an example application demonstrating how to customize the signup flow in Shopify. It is NOT production-ready and serves as a starting point for development.**

### Known Limitations

1. **Customer Account Bypass**: The standard Shopify login page remains unchanged. Customers can still:
   - Navigate directly to the native login page
   - Create accounts through the default Shopify signup form (only email)
   - Bypass the custom signup form entirely

2. **Incomplete Coverage**: For users that manage to go directly to the native signup page, make sure you:
   - Implement customer account UI extensions to get the extra data within the customer account
   - Add validation logic for accounts created outside the custom form

3. **Production Considerations**:
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Add comprehensive input validation
   - Set up monitoring and analytics
   - Handle edge cases

## 🚀 Features

- **Embeddable Signup Form**: Add a custom signup form to any page in your Shopify theme
- **Reseller Tracking**: Automatically capture and store reseller information from URL parameters
- **Structured Metafields**: Creates properly structured customer metafields for data consistency
- **App Proxy Integration**: Secure API communication through Shopify's app proxy
- **Automatic Redirects**: Seamlessly redirect customers to the login page after successful registration
- **Theme Integration**: Easy-to-configure theme extension with customizable settings

## 🔧 Configuration

### App Configuration

The app is configured through `shopify.app.toml`:

```toml
[access_scopes]
scopes = "read_customers,write_customers,write_products"

[app_proxy]
url = "https://your-app-url.com/api"
subpath = "custom-signup"
prefix = "apps"
```

### Metafield Configuration

The app automatically creates a customer metafield definition with:

- **Namespace**: `custom`
- **Key**: `reseller`
- **Type**: `single_line_text_field`
- **Visibility**: Pinned (visible in Shopify admin)

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Install the App

Install the app on your Shopify store through the Partner Dashboard or using the Shopify CLI.

### 2. Add the Signup Form to Your Theme

1. Go to your theme editor in the Shopify admin
2. Navigate to the page where you want to add the signup form
3. Add the "Custom Signup Form" section/block
4. Configure the form settings (title, button text, etc.)

### 3. Share Referral Links

Create referral links by adding the `reseller` parameter to your signup page URL:

```
https://yourstore.com/pages/signup?reseller=PARTNER_NAME
```

When customers sign up through this link, "PARTNER_NAME" will be stored in their customer metafield.

### 4. View Customer Data

Customer reseller information can be viewed in:

- Shopify Admin > Customers > [Customer Name] > Metafields
- Via the Admin API for programmatic access

## 🔍 API Endpoints

### POST `/api/custom-signup/signup`

Creates a new customer with optional reseller metafield.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "reseller": "PARTNER_NAME"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Customer created successfully"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Development

2. Install the app on your development store
3. Test the signup form with various reseller parameters

### Test Cases

- ✅ Customer creation without reseller parameter
- ✅ Customer creation with reseller parameter
- ✅ Duplicate email handling
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Redirect functionality

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

### Deploy to Shopify

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
# or
pnpm deploy
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your production environment:

- `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`
- `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`
- `SCOPES`
- `SHOPIFY_APP_URL`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. GraphQL Client: Unauthorized (401) Error**

- Ensure the app has the correct access scopes
- Check that the session is valid
- Verify the app proxy configuration
- If you are still facing issues, uninstall and install the app again in your store

**2. Metafield Not Showing in Admin**

- Run the setup route to create the metafield definition
- Check that the namespace and key match exactly

**3. Form Not Appearing in Theme**

- Verify the theme extension is properly installed
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure the app proxy URL is correctly configured

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:

```javascript
console.log("Metafield definition setup:", setupFetcher.data);
```

## 🚧 Production Improvements

To make this app production-ready, consider implementing:

### 1. Customer Account Extensions

- Use [Customer Account UI Extensions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/customer-accounts) to customize the native login/signup experience
- Implement validation rules for all customer creation paths
- Add custom fields to the native signup form

### 2. Webhook Handlers

```javascript
// Handle customers created through other channels
export const webhooks = {
  CUSTOMERS_CREATE: {
    deliveryMethod: DeliveryMethod.Http,
    callbackUrl: "/webhooks/customers/create",
    callback: async (topic, shop, body) => {
      // Check if customer has reseller metafield
      // If not, flag for review or apply default handling
    },
  },
};
```

### 3. Enhanced Validation

- Implement server-side rate limiting
- Add CAPTCHA or other anti-bot measures
- Validate email domains if needed
- Check for duplicate signup attempts
